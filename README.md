## Creating a Docker Network

To operate, Iroha requires a PostgreSQL database or RocksDB. If you prefer PostgreSQL, you will need a container running it alongside Iroha.

Let’s start with creating a Docker network, so containers for Postgres and Iroha can run on the same virtual network and successfully communicate. In this guide we will call it iroha-network, but you can use any name. In your terminal write following command:
Same for both ubuntu and Raspberry pi (ARM64)
```
sudo docker network create iroha-network

```

## Starting PostgreSQL Container

Note

You do not need to start this container if your plan is to use Iroha with RocksDB and not PostgreSQL. Just skip to the next step.

Now we need to run PostgreSQL in a container, attach it to the network you have created before, and expose ports for communication:
For Ubuntu
```
sudo docker run --name some-postgres \
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
-p 5432:5432 \
--network=iroha-network \
-d postgres:9.5 \
-c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'

```
For Raspberrypi 4
```
sudo docker pull postgres:9.5
```
```
sudo docker run --name some-postgres \
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
-p 5432:5432 \
--network=iroha-network \
-d postgres:9.5 \
-c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'
```

## Creating Blockstore

Before we run Iroha container, we may create a persistent volume to store files, storing blocks for the chain. It is done via the following command:
Same for both
```
docker volume create blockstore
```
## Preparing the configuration files¶

Note

To keep things simple, in this guide we will create a network containing only a single node. To understand how to run several peers, follow Deploy

Now we need to configure our Iroha network. This includes creating a configuration file, generating keypairs for a users, writing a list of peers and creating a genesis block.

Don’t be scared away — we have prepared an example configuration for this guide, so you can start testing Iroha node now. In order to get those files, you need to clone the Iroha repository from Github or copy them manually (cloning is faster, though).
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha --depth=1
```
Hint

--depth=1 option allows us to download only the latest commit and save some time and bandwidth. If you want to get a full commit history, you can omit this option.
If you want to run a single Iroha instance for you development needs, Iroha provided a very detailed document. You can find it here https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/deploy/single.html. Just follow that and you should be good to go. But if you want an easier way then read on.


## Starting Iroha Container¶

We are almost ready to launch our Iroha container. You just need to know the path to configuration files (from the step above).

Let’s start Iroha node in Docker container with the following command:
For ubuntu
```
sudo docker run --name iroha \
-d \
-p 50051:50051 \
-v $(pwd)/iroha/example:/opt/iroha_data \
-v blockstore:/tmp/block_store \
--network=iroha-network \
-e KEY='node0' \
hyperledger/iroha:latest

```
For Raspberrypi (ARM64)
```
sudo docker run --name iroha \
-d \
-p 50051:50051 \
-v $(pwd)/iroha/example:/opt/iroha_data \
-v blockstore:/tmp/block_store \
--network=iroha-network \
-e KEY='node0' \
msalimbe1/iroha-aarch64:dev
```
## CLI guide: sending your first transactions and queries
You can interact with Iroha using various ways. You can use our client libraries to write code in various programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, Javascript, Swift) which communicates with Iroha. Alternatively, you can use iroha-cli – our command-line tool for interacting with Iroha. As a part of this guide, let’s get familiar with iroha-cli

Attention

Despite that iroha-cli is arguably the simplest way to start working with Iroha, iroha-cli covers only some possible commands/queries, so user experience might not be the best. If you want to help us build a better CLI version please let us know!
pen a new terminal (note that Iroha container and irohad should be up and running) and attach to an iroha docker container:
```
docker exec -it iroha /bin/bash
```
Now you are in the interactive shell of Iroha’s container again. We need to launch iroha-cli and pass an account name of the desired user. In our example, the account admin is already created in the test domain. Let’s use this account to work with Iroha.
```
iroha-cli -account_name admin@test
```
Note

Full account name has a @ symbol between name and domain. Note that the keypair has the same name.

## Creating the First Transaction¶

You can see the interface of iroha-cli now. Let’s create a new asset, add some asset to the admin account and transfer it to other account. To achieve this, please choose option 1. New transaction (tx) by writing tx or 1 to a console.

Now you can see a list of available commands. Let’s try creating a new asset. Select 14. Create Asset (crt_ast). Now enter a name for your asset, for example coolcoin. Next, enter a Domain ID. In our example we already have a domain test, so let’s use it. Then we need to enter an asset precision – the amount of numbers in a fractional part. Let’s set precision to 2.

Congratulations, you have created your first command and added it to a transaction! You can either send it to Iroha or add some more commands 1. Add one more command to the transaction (add). Let’s add more commands, so we can do everything in one shot. Type add.

Now try adding some coolcoins to our account. Select 16. Add Asset Quantity (add_ast_qty), enter asset ID – coolcoin#test, integer part and coolcoin#test, integer part and precision. For example, to add 200.50 precision. For example, to add 200.50 coolcoins, we need to enter integer coolcoins, we need to enter integer part as 20050 and precision as part as 20050 and precision as 2, so it becomes 200.50.

Note

Full asset name has a # symbol between name and domain.

Let’s transfer 100.50 coolcoins from admin@test to test@test by adding one more command and choosing 5. Transfer Assets (tran_ast). Enter Source Account and Destination Account, in our case admin@test and test@test, Asset ID (coolcoin#test), integer part and precision (10050 and 2 accordingly).

Now we need to send our transaction to Iroha peer (2. Send to Iroha peer (send)). Enter peer address (in our case localhost) and port (50051). Now your transaction is submitted and you can see your transaction hash. You can use it to check transaction’s status.

Go back to a terminal where irohad is running. You can see logs of your transaction.

Yay! You have submitted your first transaction to Iroha.
## Creating the First Query¶

Now let’s check if coolcoins were successfully transferred from admin@test to test@test. Choose 2. New query (qry). 8. Get Account's Assets (get_acc_ast) can help you to check if test@test now has coolcoin. Form a query in a similar way you did with commands you did with commands and 1. Send to Iroha peer (send). Now you can see information about how many coolcoin does test@test have. It will look similar to this:

[2018-03-21 12:33:23.179275525][th:36][info] QueryResponseHandler [Account Assets]
[2018-03-21 12:33:23.179329199][th:36][info] QueryResponseHandler -Account Id:- test@test
[2018-03-21 12:33:23.179338394][th:36][info] QueryResponseHandler -Asset Id- coolcoin#test
[2018-03-21 12:33:23.179387969][th:36][info] QueryResponseHandler -Balance- 100.50

Isn’t that awesome? You have submitted your first query to Iroha and got a response!
